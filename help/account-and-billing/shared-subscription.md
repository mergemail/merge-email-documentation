### How will it impact my invoices? <a href="#h.airhebwcenyd_l" id="h.airhebwcenyd_l"></a>

* **Adding or removing user to a subscription will not change billing period or billing dates** : your billing date, monthly or yearly will remain the same than the original subscription.
* **If you add a new license to a shared subscription** :
  * You will be **charged immediately** for the prorated remaining time before the next invoice.
  * Your **next invoice** will reflect the new number of licences of your subscription.

_Example:_

_If you have a yearly subscription ($47.88) created on 1st January 2022 and you add a license on 1st of June 2022:_

1. _You will be charged immediately for $23.94 (because there is half of the billing period remaining)_
2. _Next invoice on 1st January2023 will be $95.76 ( = 2x $47.88)_



* **If you remove a license from a shared subscription** :
  * Your account balance will be credited with the prorated amount for the remaining time of your subscription.
  * Your **next invoice** will reflect the new number of licences of your subscription.

_Example :_

_If you have a monthly subscription with 4 licenses for a monthly cost of $19.86 (4x$4.99) and you decide to remove a licence : next invoice will be $14.97 (3x$4.99)_
