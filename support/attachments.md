* The attachment has to be present in your (or in a public) Google Drive
* Attachment size should be under 5 Mb

If not done yet, here is how to add a file to Google Drive :

1. From [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive), locate and select the **New** button, then select **File upload**.
2. Locate and **select the** **file(s)** you want to upload on your computer, then click **Open**.
3. The File is now visible in your **Google Drive**.
4. Don't close Google Drive right now, we will need it in the next step !

### Attachment issues: <a href="#h.e0w4cxplbpwm_l" id="h.e0w4cxplbpwm_l"></a>

Here are the most common errors encountered with attachments:

**1- Message "Attachment Error, Limit Exceeded: Email Total Attachments Size should not exceed 5Mb":**

There is a limit on the size you are allowed to send with Gmail (It's a limitation decided by Google), we can't do anything about that.
