# Unsubscribe link

### How to include an unsubscribe link?

There are 2 ways to include an unsubscribe link in your template with different advantages :&#x20;

1. [Insert the standardized unsubscribe complete footer](unsubscribe-link.md#insert-the-standardized-unsubscribe-footer) - takes a second, and looks very standard
2. [Insert an unsubscribe link](unsubscribe-link.md#insert-an-unsubscribe-link) - more customizable

### How would it look for my recipients?

Whenever one of your recipients clicks to unsubscribe, they will be redirected to a page like the following:

### How would it look to me?

When one of your recipients unsubscribe, you will know it through the tracking status of your campaign :&#x20;

### Insert an unsubscribe link

To add an unsubscribe link, you will need to insert the unsubscribe variable as shown below. It will be replaced by a special link that Mail Merge for Gmail uses to handle unsubscribes.&#x20;

Here's how to do it:&#x20;

1. In Mail Merge for Gmail, open your template or create a new one.
2. In the editor, add the following text "_Click here to unsubscribe_" (or any other message of your choice)
3. Select the text then click on **Insert/Edit link** ðŸ”—
4. In the "Insert/Edit link" popup, select "Unsubscribe" in the dropdown "Link List"
5. Click "Save"

<div>

</div>



When sending your emails, Mail Merge for Gmail will automatically convert the special variable with a unique unsubscribe link letting each of your contact opting-out easily, **so be careful to not change the URL by yourself.**

Please not than in the template editor, the unsubscribe link is not active.
