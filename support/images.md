# Images

Adding visible images to an email is possible with Mail Merge for Gmail. There are 3 possibilities:&#x20;

* the **image is located on your computer**, read [Insert a local image](images.md#insert-a-local-image)
* the **image is located on your Google Drive**, read [Insert an image from Google Drive™](images.md#insert-an-image-from-google-drive-tm)
* the **image is available through a public URL**, read [Insert a distant image](images.md#insert-a-distant-image)

After being added to the template, you can still edit the image, see Edit an image.

the image size, orientation, and alignment can be edited, just click on the image to display the image toolbox.

## Insert a local image&#x20;

You can't directly add a local image to your email, because it has to be accessible online! You can use a hosting service, **but we provide a convenient (and free) solution**: host your images on Google Drive:&#x20;

* Go to [https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive)

* Set the permissions to **"Anyone with the link"** / **"Viewer"**. :warning: :warning:Be careful, if you set "Editor", everyone will able to change your image which is probably not something you wish.:warning::warning:

Then go to the next chapter : ["Insert an image from Google Drive"](images.md#undefined)

## Insert an image from Google Drive™

To add a Google Drive-hosted image to your emails, from the editor click on the Google Drive image icon ![](<../.gitbook/assets/gdrive icon.png>). This will open a modal, allowing you to choose your Google Drive image.

## Insert a distant image

To add a remote picture to your emails, from the editor click on the image icon ![](../.gitbook/assets/remotepiclogo.png). This will open a modal, allowing you to insert your picture's "source" URL.&#x20;
