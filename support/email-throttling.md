  Email throttling is a way to improve your email deliverability. By reducing
  the speed of emails sending, it triggers less email providers' attention and
  ensures your account stays in good standards.

# Email throttling

### How it works

When activated, email throttling will add a delay between **each email.**&#x20;

For instance, if you want to send a batch of 6 emails, with a 10minutes throttling setup, it will take 1 hour to send all your emails (6 emails x 10 minutes).

{% hint style="info" %}
Throttling is a global setting, meaning all campaigns sent after changing it will follow the new throttling configuration.

These settings can be updated at any time.
{% endhint %}

### How to activate email throttling

#### 1 - Go to app settings

To activate or edit email throttling, got to app settings from the home screen :

#### 2 - Choose throttling mode

From there, you can choose between 3 sending modes :&#x20;

* **Email blast** (by default) : when selecting this setting emails are sent as fast as possible, with a minimum delay between each emails.
* **Add a delay between each email** : This mode allows you to send emails with a fixed delay.
* **Add a random delay between emails** : This mode is also sending email with throttling, but this time you are not setting the delay between each emails, but the maximum delay between each emails

#### 3 - Select the delay you want to use

If you select a mode with delay, you can now select a delay (or maximum delay) between each emails. (you can select a delay between 1 and 60 minutes) .

Now save your settings, and your next email campaign will be throttled.

{% hint style="warning" %}
For large campaigns, selecting an important delay may considerably increase the time required to deliver the campaign.&#x20;

If you accidentally set a delay that is too long, you can still [cancel the on going email campaign](canceling-an-email-campaign.md).
