# Canceling an Email Campaign

### Cancel a Scheduled Campaign

This feature is helpful if you’ve scheduled a campaign and want to cancel it before it sends.

* Click on “Manage Schedule.”
* Find your campaign in the list of scheduled campaigns and click on the red trash icon, then confirm by clicking “Delete Campaign.”

The status of your campaign in the Google Sheet is then updated to “Deleted.”

### Cancel a Campaign Sent Using the “Undo Send” Feature

This option is useful if you’ve sent a campaign and immediately realize there’s an error.

As soon as you click the “Send X emails” button, a new window opens.&#x20;

You have **5 seconds to cancel the send** by clicking the “Abort” button.

You’ll see your email reappear, and a note stating “No email was sent” will display at the bottom of the screen.

No status is updated in the Google Sheet.\

### Cancel an Ongoing Email Campaign

This option is for when the 5-second window to click “Abort” has passed.

It is only relevant if you are sending a large number of emails; this method allows you to stop **part of the campaign** from sending, though not the entire campaign, as the initial emails from your Google Sheet are sent almost immediately.

This means this function helps **reduce the impact,** as the first recipients on your list will inevitably receive the email.

To proceed, act **quickly**:

1. Restart Mail Merge (Extensions > Mail Merge for Gmail > ▶️Start).
2. Find your campaign under “Active Campaign.”
3. You can either suspend it by clicking “Pause” or delete it by clicking “Delete.”

The campaign’s status in the Google Sheet will then change: if deleted, it shows as “Deleted”; if paused, it displays as “In queue.” Emails already sent are marked as “Sent.”\
