### How to add multiple recipients in Mail Merge <a href="#h.lqah32qvi41l_l" id="h.lqah32qvi41l_l"></a>

There are multiple ways to add multiple recipients to a single email: either by adding CC or BCC fields, or directly by adding multiple emails in the recipient field. Let's see how to proceed.

### Add multiple recipients, eventually CC and BCC column in your Spreadsheet: <a href="#h.7gjncqo4r69_l" id="h.7gjncqo4r69_l"></a>

To add multiple recipients, simply type emails in your recipient column, separated by commas.

_ex: nathan@company.com, mathias@company.com_

### (Optional) Add CC and BCC column in your Spreadsheet : <a href="#h.wes2cpwybyh_l" id="h.wes2cpwybyh_l"></a>

If you want to add **CC** (Carbon Copy) and/or **BCC** (Blind Carbon Copy):

* You need to create one distinct column for CC and one other for BCC
* same as recipients, you can add a single email or multiple emails separated by character comma.

### Setup CC & BCC in Mail Merge for Gmail <a href="#h.me3e303zmxgf_l" id="h.me3e303zmxgf_l"></a>

At this step you need to "tell" **Mail Merge for Gmail** that you have columns with emails and you want to use them as CC and/or BCC.

* In the add-on, click on "**More options**"
* Select the right column for "**CC**" and/or "**BCC**".
* If everything is ok, the preview should now show CC and / or BCC according to your data.

### Quotas & Multi-recipients: <a href="#h.g3pyytes0e9e_l" id="h.g3pyytes0e9e_l"></a>

Using the multi-recipients feature in **Mail Merge for Gmail** has a direct effect on your daily quota:

* If you are sending one email with 1 person in CC and 1 in BCC, in reality, your email will be sent to 3 people, your daily quota will be reduced by 3 after the send.
* If you are sending one email with 3 people and 2 in CC, your daily quota will be reduced by 5 (3+2) after the send.
