## Personalize your email content

With Mail Merge for GmailðŸ“£, **you can change the content of each email received** by each recipient. This is what we call personalization.&#x20;

### Start with the Google Sheet content

The idea is simple, in your Google Sheet, **each row will represent an email.** The minimal requirement to send a campaign is to have a column with all the recipients _(Column "A" in the screenshot below)_.

You can add as many columns as you want, and you will be able to retrieve them in the template editor._( Column Name / Company ...)_

### Customize your email template

In the template editor, You are now able to retrieve your Spreadsheet data to customize your emails, through what we call **merge tags.**&#x20;

Merge tags are simply names of your columns, surrounded with characters \{{ \}}. For instance, if you want to use the "Name" column in your template, bring it with \{{ Name\}}.

You don't have to type merge tags, just use our dropdown menu :&#x20;
