Install Mail Merge for Gmail from the [Google Workspace marketplace](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/mail\_merge\_for\_gmail\_%F0%9F%93%A3/562406866377) if you haven’t already done so by clicking on the “Install” button.

* A pop-up will ask for your authorization to install the addon, click on Continue
* Another popup will ask you for some permissions, click on "Allow"

After the installation (it usually takes less than 15 seconds) you will get a popup, saying that add-on has been installed.

### Installation issues: <a href="#h.2zr90orf384h_l" id="h.2zr90orf384h_l"></a>

There are two known issues that we can't fix, as it doesn't depend on Mail Merge for Gmail:

**1- Add-on doesn't seem to be installed successfully / I never get the "addon-installed successfully" popup:**

This issue can occur when you sign in Google accounts, and you are not using the principal account for installation. An easy workaround is to open a private window, sign in to the Google account you want, then proceed to the installation.

**2- After successful installation, Merge for Gmail is not visible in Google Sheets:**

Simply refresh Google Sheets, wait for 10 seconds, and it should appear in the menu!
